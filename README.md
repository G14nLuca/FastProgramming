What is Fast Programming?

Brazilian YouTuber Filipe Deschamps, in his video "Desafio: 10 projetos rápidos para treinar Programação e conseguir um Emprego" (Challenge: 10 Quick Projects to train programming and get a job), compiled both Indrek Lasn's article "Need Inspiration? Here Are 5 Challenging App Ideas You Can Start Building Today" and Web Dev Simplified's video "5 Projects You Can Build In A Week That Will Get You Hired"  in one single list.

I'm a lazy and anxious person. Although I want to get hired as a programmer as soon as possible, I never really sat down and told myself "Gian, this is the project you're going to develop using these technologies. Now let's study and do some coding.". Honestly, I'm tired of this.

So, yes, Fast Programming is my way to make myself study and code outside college projects. I have to do something if I want to get a job. Let's get to work.

Which projects will I be developing?

In a non-specific order:
1) An Online Rich-Text Editor with Word, PDF and HTML exports;
2) Calendar;
3) Catalog websites;
4) An e-commerce experience;
5) Spotify clone;
6) Github's Repositories Search Engine with filters application;
7) Windows's Task Manager clone;
8) My own online multiplayer game
9) Any project of my own using a third-party API
10) My own portfolio page
